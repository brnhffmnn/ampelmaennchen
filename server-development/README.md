# Running the server

The development server is configured to run on port `8080` and has auto-reload enabled.
You can run it by starting `Application.main()` from your favourite IDE/console or invoke `gradlew server-development:run`.

Changes to files belonging to the core or development module will be hot-replaced automatically once they are (re-)compiled.
